# Mini Project 2: Neural Networks and Fault Detection

## Machine Learning Course - K.N.Toosi University

### Instructor: Dr. Aliyari

This mini project is part of the Machine Learning course taught by Dr. Aliyari at K.N.Toosi University. The objective of this project is to implement, evaluate, and visualize neural networks, and apply fault detection techniques.

## Project Description

### Objectives
1. **Neural Networks**: Implement and analyze neural networks for classification tasks.
2. **Fault Detection**: Work with fault detection datasets to apply machine learning techniques.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Understand and apply hyperparameter tuning for optimizing models.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the decision boundaries and performance of the models.

### Tasks
1. **Activation Functions and Neuron Models**:
    - Compare the effects of ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions in a binary classification task.
    - Implement and analyze alternative activation functions.
    - Design and implement a simple neuron or McCulloch-Pitts neuron to classify points in a 2D space.

2. **Fault Detection Dataset**:
    - Work with the CWRU Bearing dataset to classify different fault conditions.
    - Extract features and prepare the dataset for machine learning models.
    - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and explain the importance of each split.

3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**:
    - Build a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron model with at least 2 hidden layers.
    - Train the model on the prepared dataset and visualize the training and validation accuracy.
    - Evaluate the model using confusion matrices and classification reports.

4. **Advanced Techniques**:
    - Compare different optimization functions and their effects on model performance.
    - Implement k-fold cross-validation and explain its benefits.
    - Experiment with different regularization techniques and their impact on the model.
