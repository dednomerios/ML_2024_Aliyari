# Mini Project 3: Support Vector Machines and Classification Techniques

## Machine Learning Course - K.N.Toosi University

### Instructor: Dr. Aliyari

This mini project is part of the Machine Learning course taught by Dr. Aliyari at K.N.Toosi University. The objective of this project is to implement, evaluate, and visualize various classification techniques, focusing on Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

## Project Description

### Objectives
1. **Support Vector Machines**: Implement and analyze SVMs for classification tasks.
2. **Data Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction**: Use techniques like t-SNE for visualization.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize SVMs using different kernels and hyperparameters.
4. **Advanced Implementation**: Implement SVM from scratch and compare with scikit-learn.

### Tasks
1. **Experiment with SVM on the Iris Dataset**:
    - Load and visualize the Iris dataset.
    - Use t-SNE to reduce dimensions and visualize the dataset.
    - Implement SVM with linear and kernel methods.
    - Visualize decision boundaries and confusion matrices.

2. **Kernel Comparisons**:
    - Compare different kernel methods (e.g., linear, polynomial) using scikit-learn.
    - Create a GIF of decision boundaries for different polynomial degrees (1 to 10).

3. **Implement SVM from Scratch**:
    - Implement a basic SVM classifier without using scikit-learn.
    - Include methods for fitting the model and making predictions.
    - Compare the results with scikit-learn's SVM.

4. **Generalized Multiclass SVM**:
    - Study and summarize the paper "GenSVM: A Generalized Multiclass Support Vector Machine".
    - Implement and compare GenSVM with traditional SVM on the Iris dataset.

5. **Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Autoencoders**:
    - Study and summarize the paper on autoencoder neural networks for credit card fraud detection.
    - Implement the autoencoder model and evaluate its performance.
    - Visualize results using confusion matrices and performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
