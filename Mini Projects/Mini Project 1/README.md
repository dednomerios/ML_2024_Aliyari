# Mini Project 1: Linear Classification Model

## Machine Learning Course - K.N.Toosi University

### Instructor: Dr. Aliyari

This mini project is part of the Machine Learning course taught by Dr. Aliyari at K.N.Toosi University. The objective of this project is to implement, evaluate, and visualize a linear classification model.

## Project Description

### Objectives
1. **Train and Evaluate a Linear Classifier**: Learn to train and evaluate a linear classification model using scikit-learn.
2. **Visualize the Decision Boundaries**: Understand how the model makes decisions by visualizing the decision boundaries.
3. **Apply Linear Algebra**: Apply linear algebra concepts to enhance understanding of the underlying mathematics in machine learning models.

### Tasks
1. **Diagram of the Training and Evaluation Process**:
    - Create a block diagram showing the process of training and evaluating a linear classification model.
    - Explain the changes when switching from binary to multiclass classification.

2. **Generate and Visualize a Dataset**:
    - Use `sklearn.datasets` to generate a dataset with 4 classes and 1000 samples.
    - Visualize the dataset and discuss the challenges it presents.

3. **Training with Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - Use a linear classifier from `sklearn.linear_model` and describe the process of hyperparameter tuning.
    - Evaluate and display the model's accuracy and other metrics.

4. **Decision Boundary Visualization**:
    - Visualize the decision boundaries and regions produced by the trained model.
    - Highlight misclassified samples.

5. **Repeat with Different Parameters**:
    - Repeat the process with different features and classes using `drawdata` tool.
    - Present the results in a clear and organized manner.
