# Machine Learning Course - K.N.Toosi University

## Instructor: Dr. Aliyari

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository for the course taught by Dr. Aliyari at K.N.Toosi University. This repository contains all the Mini-Projects and Homework assignments related to the Machine Learning course.

## Course Overview

This course provides an in-depth understanding of machine learning concepts and algorithms. Throughout the course, students will work and get familiar with concepts including basic concept in ML, Linear Regressions and classifiers, Dimension Reduction, SVM, Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Mini-Projects**: Contains 4 mini-projects demonstrating different machine learning concepts and techniques.
- **Homework**: Contains all the extra homework assignments given during the course.
- **Practice Codes**: Contains all the Practice codes from tutorials via Videos and Workshops.
